    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in
        your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, 
        such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve
        given you their permission.
        We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. 
        You provide Google with that permission through this license.
    </p>
    <b>What’s covered</b>
    <p>This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>
    <b>What’s not covered</b>
    <ul>
        <li>This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights</li>
        <li>publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local
            business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that 
            everyone’s free to use.
        </li>
        <li>feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the 
            Service-related communications section below.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world</li>
        <li>non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others</li>
        <li>royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on
            our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go</li>
        <li>publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others</li>
        <li>modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it</li>
        <li>other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with 
            people you choose</li>
        <li>our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the 
            limited purposes described in the Purpose section below</li>
    </ul>
